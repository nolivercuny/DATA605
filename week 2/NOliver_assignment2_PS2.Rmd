# Assignment 2

## Problem set 1

(1) Show that \[A^TA \neq AA^T\] in general. (Proof and demonstration.)
(2) For a special type of square matrix A, we get AT A = AAT . Under what conditions
could this be true? (Hint: The Identity matrix I is an example of such a matrix).
Please typeset your response using LaTeX mode in RStudio. 

\[
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1&2&3\\4&5&6
\end{bmatrix}
\\
A^T = \begin{bmatrix}
1&4\\2&5\\3&6
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Hint: take the transposes of 𝐴𝐴𝑇 and 𝐴𝑇𝐴. Use what you know about the transpose to show (𝐴𝐴𝑇)𝑇=𝐴𝐴𝑇, and (𝐴𝑇𝐴)𝑇=𝐴𝑇𝐴

In particular, if you are still struggling:

(𝐴𝐴𝑇)𝑇=(𝐴𝑇)𝑇𝐴𝑇=𝐴𝐴𝑇
Can you do the second?
```{r}
A = matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
A
tA = t(A)
tA

A * tA
tA * A


A = diag(2)
A
t(A)
```

## Problem set 2

Matrix factorization is a very important problem. There are supercomputers built just to do matrix factorizations. Every second you are on an airplane, matrices are being factorized. Radars that track flights use a technique called Kalman filtering. At the heart of Kalman Filtering is a Matrix Factorization operation. Kalman Filters are solving linear systems of equations when they track your flight using radars.

Write an R function to factorize a square matrix A into LU or LDU, whichever you prefer. 
You don’t have to worry about permuting rows of A and you can assume that A is less than 5x5, if you need to hard-code any variables in your code. If you doing the entire assignment in R, then please submit only one markdown document for both the problems.

```{r}
#Doolittle Algorithm
factorizeIntoLU <- function(A) {
  n <- dim(A)[1] #assuming square matrix
  
  L <- diag(0,n)
  U <- diag(0,n)

  for (i in seq(1,n)) {
		for (k in seq(i, n)) {
			sum <- 0;
			for (j in seq(1,i)) {
				sum <- sum + (L[i, j] * U[j, k]);
			}
			U[i, k] <- A[i, k] - sum;
		}
		for (k in seq(i,n)){
			if (i == k){
				L[i, i] <- 1
			}
			else {
				sum <- 0;
				for (j in seq(1,i)){
					sum <- sum + (L[k, j] * U[j, i]);
				}
				L[k, i] <- (A[k, i] - sum) / U[i, i];
			}
		}
  }
print('L')
print(L)
print('U')
print(U)
}
A <- matrix(c(2,-1,-2,-4,6,3,-4-2,8),nrow = 3, byrow=TRUE)
A
factorizeIntoLU(A)
matrixcalc::lu.decomposition(A)
A <- matrix(c(1,4,-3,-2,8,5,3,4,7),nrow = 3, byrow=TRUE)
A
factorizeIntoLU(A)

matrixcalc::lu.decomposition(A)
